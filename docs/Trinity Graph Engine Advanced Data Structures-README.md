1. # Trinity Graph Engine Advanced Data Structures

   A comprehensive implementation of advanced graph data structures using Microsoft's Trinity Graph Engine with Language Integrated Knowledge Query (LIKQ) framework, featuring ontological integration with Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) 2020.

   ## Overview

   This repository provides a complete, production-ready implementation of various advanced graph data structures including red-black trees, skip lists, directed graphs, multi-graphs, hypergraphs, and colored hypergraphs. The implementation leverages the distributed computing capabilities of Trinity Graph Engine and the expressive traversal syntax of LIKQ.

   The project approaches graph data structures from both a technical and philosophical perspective, integrating the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) 2020 framework to provide a rigorous ontological foundation for understanding and implementing graph algorithms.

   ## Features

   - **Comprehensive Data Structure Implementations**:
     - Red-Black Trees (self-balancing binary search trees)
     - Skip Lists (probabilistic balanced structures)
     - Directed Graphs (with cycle detection and path finding)
     - Multi-graphs (supporting multiple edges between vertices)
     - Hypergraphs (edges connecting arbitrary numbers of vertices)
     - Colored Hypergraphs (with type assignments)

   - **BFO 2020 Integration**:
     - Ontological classification of graph elements
     - Formal relation modeling
     - Constraint and invariant specification using BFO concepts

   - **Advanced LIKQ Query Examples**:
     - Complex graph traversals
     - Pattern matching
     - Path finding with constraints
     - Cycle detection
     - Strongly connected component analysis

   - **Performance Optimizations**:
     - Memory management strategies
     - Indexing techniques
     - Locality-aware algorithms
     - LIKQ query optimization

      ## Usage Examples
      
      ### Creating a Directed Graph
      
      ```csharp
      // Create a new directed graph model
      var graph = new DirectedGraphModel
      {
       graph = new DirectedGraph
       {
           vertexCount = 0,
           edgeCount = 0
       },
       vertices = new List<Vertex>(),
       edges = new List<Edge>()
      };
      
      // Add vertices and edges
      AddVertex(graph, 1, "Vertex 1");
      AddVertex(graph, 2, "Vertex 2");
      AddEdge(graph, 1, 1, 2, "Edge 1->2");
      
      // Save the graph
      long graphId = Global.LocalStorage.SaveDirectedGraphModel(graph);
      ```

      ### Finding Paths Using LIKQ

      csharp

      ```csharp
      // Using LIKQ to find paths from source to target
      var paths = KnowledgeGraph
          .StartFrom(graphId)
          .VisitNode(graph => graph.continue_if(graph.type("DirectedGraphModel")))
          .FollowEdge("vertices")
          .VisitNode(vertex => {
              long id = long.Parse(vertex.get("id"));
              return vertex.continue_if(id == sourceId);
          })
          .FollowEdge("outEdges")
          .VisitNode(edge => Action.Continue)
          .FollowEdge("target")
          .VisitNode(targetVertex => {
              long id = long.Parse(targetVertex.get("id"));
              return targetVertex.return_if(id == targetId);
          })
          .ToList();
      ```

      ### BFO-aware Traversal

      csharp

      ```csharp
      // Find entities of a specific BFO type
      var entitiesOfType = KnowledgeGraph
          .StartFrom(ontologyId)
          .VisitNode(ontology => ontology.continue_if(ontology.type("BFOOntologyModel")))
          .FollowEdge("entities")
          .VisitNode(entity => {
              int type = int.Parse(entity.get("entityType"));
              return entity.return_if(type == (int)BFOEntityType.IndependentContinuant);
          })
          .ToList();
      ```
